# Discord Bot üõ†Ô∏è
Welcome to [DiscordBot](https://github.com/BlackNinjaKR/DiscordBot), an all-in-one bot designed to enhance any Discord server. From moderation to entertainment, this bot includes a variety of commands and features to meet your server's needs.

> **_NOTE:_** Be sure to replace the bot token in your `.env` file with your own. I've reset the token on my application to ensure security for all users.

### What This Bot Can Do üéâ

DiscordBot is designed as a multi-functional tool for your server, offering features like:

1. Moderation (ban, kick, mute, etc.)
2. Fun commands (games, jokes, memes)
3. Utility commands (polls, reminders, etc.)
4. Music streaming
5. ...And much more!

This bot was built with versatility in mind to help communities thrive.

### Open for Contributions üåé

This bot is officially feature-complete, but I welcome pull requests. Feel free to add to it, customize it, or adapt it for your own use. Even though I‚Äôm not actively adding new features, I look forward to seeing where the community takes it!

# The Story Behind DiscordBot ‚ù£
DiscordBot holds a special place in my coding journey as it was not only the very first bot but also the very first personal coding project I ever built. In creating it, I was learning the ropes of development, experimenting, and pushing boundaries‚Äîall with the hope of making a bot that could be useful in countless ways. With this bot, I wanted to build something versatile, something that could support different communities and meet a variety of needs.

I hope this bot brings the same excitement and connection to your server as it did to mine. Thanks for being part of its story. üéß
